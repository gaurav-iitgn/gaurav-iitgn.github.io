* Course objectives, syllabus, books, video lectures, pre-requisites
** Objectives
- To learn fundamentals of structural analysis.
- To develop simple computer programs to perform structural analysis.

** After finishing this course, you will
- know how to analyse simple structures by hand
- know how to use computer programming to analyze large structural systems
- understand linear analysis of structures

** Syllabus
- Review of some concepts from Mechanics of Solids.
- Degrees of indeterminacy (static and kinematic).
- Types and analysis of trusses, cables, arches, beams, columns and frames.
- Specific methods to be covered: moment area theorem; conjugate beam method; principle of virtual work; energy method; Castiglianoâ€™s theorems; unit-load and unit-displacement theorems; reciprocal theorems; Betti's and Maxwell's theorem; method of consistent deformations; slope-deflection method; displacement based methods; moment distribution method; column analogy method
- Influence lines; Muller-Breslau's principle
- Matrix method of analysis (if time permits)

** Text Book
- Structural Analysis 5th edition - Devdas Menon, Narosa Publishing House Pvt. Ltd.

** Reference Books
- Structural Analysis - R.C. Hibbeler, Prentice Hall.
- Structural Analysis - Aslam Kassimali, Cengage Learning.
- Matrix Structural Analysis - W. McGuire, R.H. Gallagher, R.D. Ziemian (available here: http://www.mastan2.com/textbook.html).

** Software
- Simple computer codes for analysis will be developed in Python.
- SAP2000 will be used for more complicated analyses.
- Another useful software tool is MASTAN2 (http://www.mastan2.com/)

** Video lectures
- Recorded lectures covering most of the syllabus are available [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU9GYaHTggY&list=PLKg8NoX0BvK3NuUsHHFGsEV4bZ2UkPFa7][here]].
- You may use these to revise/learn in advance certain topics.

** Pre-requisites
- Curiosity about how structural systems (buildings, bridges, dams, etc.) are designed -- analysis is essential for design.
- Good background of solid mechanics and any programming language.

* Course Policies
** Etiquette
- Please be considerate about everyone's time.
- In all emails pertaining to this course, please have "CE302" in the subject line.
	- (note that there is no space or hyphen or anything between CE and 302)

** Cheating
Cheating (in assignments/quizzes/exams) is unacceptable. It is expected that this will never happen and everyone will uphold the honor code.

** Late submissions
All delays beyond the defined deadlines will attract reduction in marks as per the following curve.
The reduction factor, $R$ will be multiplied to the obtained marks. Mathematically, it is given by: $R = \exp(-D^2)$, where $D$ is the total delay in days (will be counted hourly, i.e. fractional days are possible).

** Grading
Following will be the weightage of different components of assessment
| Component            | Weightage |
|----------------------+-----------|
| Homework assignments |       30% |
| Spot quizzes         |       20% |
| Class participation  |       10% |
| Midsem exam          |       20% |
| Endsem exam          |       20% |

** Modes of formal assessment
- Assignments will involve detailed analysis and hands-on questions.
- Expect one assignment per week.
- Spot quizzes will primarily be objective type, primarily based on concepts and codes. Expect one quiz per week.
- Exam will primarily be subjective type. It may be in-class or take-home.

** Emphasis on self-learning
It is important to develop the habit of self-learning. A number of reading assignments and self-exercises will be given during the course. These will not be formally graded and it will be expected that students will go through them on a regular basis on their own.
