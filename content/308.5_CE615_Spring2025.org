* Course Policies
** Etiquette
- Please be considerate about everyone's time.
- In all emails pertaining to this course, please have "CE615" in the subject line.
	- (note that there is no space or hyphen or anything between CE and 615)

** Cheating
Cheating cases (assignments/codes/exams/project) will be dealt with in accordance with the Institute norms. It is expected that everyone will uphold the honor code.

** Grading
Following will be the weightage of different components of assessment
| Component            | Weightage |
|----------------------+-----------|
| Homework assignments |       30% |
| Group projects       |       30% |
| Exams (two)          |  20% each |

** Modes of formal assessment
- Assignments will entail analysis/practical problems, reports, etc. and may be individual or group
- Group projects will involve more aggregating tasks including small amount of coding, use of a software, or design of larger systems.
	
** Emphasis on self-learning
It is important to develop the habit of self-learning. A number of reading assignments and self-exercises will be given during the course. These will not be formally graded and it will be expected that students will go through them on a regular basis on their own.
