* Course objectives, syllabus, books, pre-requisites
** Objectives
- To learn about the effects of fire on reinforced concrete and steel structures.
- To learn about the behavior and characterization of fires of different kinds.
- To be able to design reinforced concrete and steel structures under fire conditions.
	
** Syllabus
- Fire characteristics (combustion, ignition, flammability limits, etc.)
- Properties of steel and concrete at high temperatures.
- Heat transfer mechanisms: conduction, convection and radiation. Mathematical modeling of the heat transfer problem.
- Fire as a hazard; development of a fire in the open and in a compartment.
- Stages of a compartment fire: pre-flashover, flashover and post-flashover.
- Characterization of a fire through time-temperature and time-HRR; t^2 fire model.
- Estimation of fire curves through fire load energy density and compartment characteristics. Ventilation factor; fuel vs. ventilation controlled fire.
- Design and parametric fire curves.
- Heat transfer within concrete structures (semi-infinite idealization) and steel structures (lumped capacity idealization).
- Empirical and code-based methods to compute temperature within structural systems.
- Design of steel structures under fire.
- Design of reinforced concrete structures under fire; 500 isotherm method, zone method.
- Equivalent fire severity.
		
** Textbook
- Fire-resistant Design of Structures by S. Chandrasekaran and G. Srivastava, CRC Press.

* Course Policies
** Etiquette
- Please be considerate about everyone's time.
- In all emails pertaining to this course, please have "CE615" in the subject line.
	- (note that there is no space or hyphen or anything between CE and 615)

** Cheating
Cheating cases (assignments/codes/exams/project) will be dealt with in accordance with the Institute norms. It is expected that everyone will uphold the honor code.

** Grading
Following will be the weightage of different components of assessment
| Component            | Weightage |
|----------------------+-----------|
| Homework assignments |       30% |
| Group projects       |       20% |
| Exams (two)          |  25% each |

** Modes of formal assessment
- Assignments will entail analysis/practical problems, coding, reports, etc. and may be individual or group.
- Group projects will involve more aggregating tasks including coding, use of a software, or design of larger systems.
- Exams may be in-class or take-home.
	
** Emphasis on self-learning
It is important to develop the habit of self-learning. A number of reading assignments and self-exercises will be given during the course. These will not be formally graded and it will be expected that students will go through them on a regular basis on their own.
