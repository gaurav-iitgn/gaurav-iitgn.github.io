* Course objectives, syllabus, books, pre-requisites
** Objectives
- To learn the fundamentals of analyzing reinforced concrete structural members.
- To learn design of basic structural members of a reinforced concrete building.
- To learn overall structual design of a reinforced concrete building.
	
** Syllabus
- Properties of concrete and steel.
- Design philosophies.
- Loads and load combinations.
- Analysis and design of beams, columns, slabs, stair case and shallow foundations.
- Ductile detailing.
- (if time permits: ) design of shear walls, seismic design.

		
** Textbook
- Reinforced Concrete Design - S Unnikrishna Pillai and Devdas Menon.
	- Respective sections from the book to be read `before' the class, will be mentioned against the lectures.
	
** Reference Books
- Limit State Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures - P C Verghese.

** Required codes
- IS 456(2000): Plain and reinforced concrete - Code of Practice
- IS 875-1(1987): Code of practice for design loads (other than earthquake) for buildings and structures [Dead Loads]
- IS 875-2(1987): Code of practice for design loads (other than earthquake) for buildings and structures [Imposed Loads]
- IS 875-3(2015): Code of practice for design loads (other than earthquake) for buildings and structures [Wind Loads]
- SP 16(1980): Design aids for reinforced concrete to IS 456
- Please have a copy of the codes available during classes, tutorials and exams

** Pre-requisites
- Good background in Mechanics of Solids.
- Good background in Structural Analysis.
- Curiosity to learn the fundamentals behind construction of some of the largest structures like Hoover Dam and Burj Khalifa.

* Course Policies
** Etiquette
- Please be considerate about everyone's time.
- In all emails pertaining to this course, please have "CE304" in the subject line.
	- (note that there is no space or hyphen or anything between CE and 304)

** Cheating
Cheating cases (assignments/codes/exams/project) will be dealt with in accordance with the Institute norms. It is expected that everyone will uphold the honor code.

** Late submissions
All delays beyond the defined deadlines will attract reduction in marks as per the following curve.
The reduction factor, $R$ will be multiplied to the obtained marks. Mathematically, it is given by: $R = \exp(-D^2)$, where $D$ is the total delay in days (will be counted hourly, i.e. fractional days are possible).

** Grading
Following will be the weightage of different components of assessment
| Component            | Weightage |
|----------------------+-----------|
| Homework assignments |       40% |
| In-class submissions |       15% |
| Tutorials            |       15% |
| Exams (two)          |  15% each |

** Modes of formal assessment
- Tutorials will involve two types of problems:
	- Set A: to be submitted within the tutorial hour and will be graded towards Tutorial weightage
	- Set B: to be practiced outside the tutorial hour and will not be graded
- Assignments will entail analysis/design problems, practical problems, visit reports, etc.
- Exams will involve take home type analysis/design problems along with viva/presentations.
- Expect one assignment and tutorial per week.
- In-class submissions will comprise of small problems to be solved in-class (in groups).
	
** Emphasis on self-learning
It is important to develop the habit of self-learning. A number of reading assignments and self-exercises will be given during the course. These will not be formally graded and it will be expected that students will go through them on a regular basis on their own.
