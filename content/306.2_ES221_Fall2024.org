** Syllabus
- Free body diagram, Modeling of supports, Conditions for Equilibrium.
- Friction Force-deformation relationship and geometric compatibility (for small deformations) with illustrations through simple problems on axially loaded members and thin walled pressure vessels.
- Axial force, shear force, bending moment, and twisting moment diagrams of slender members.
- Concept of stress and strain at a point, Transformation of stresses and strain at a point, Principal stresses and strains, Mohr’s circle (only for plane stress and strain case).
- Displacement field, Strain Rosette, Modeling of problem as a plane stress or plane strain problem.
- Discussion of experimental results on 1-D material behavior.
- Concepts of elasticity, plasticity, strain-hardening, failure (fracture/yielding), idealization of 1-D stress-strain curve, Concepts of isotropy, orthotropy, anisotropy.

** Reference Books
- Strength of Materials - S. Timoshenko.

** Pre-requisites
- Good background in Mathematics.
- Curiosity to learn the fundamentals behind construction of some of the largest structures like Hoover Dam and Burj Khalifa.

* Course Policies
** Etiquette
- Please be considerate about everyone's time.
- In all emails pertaining to this course, please have "ES221" in the subject line.
	- (note that there is no space or hyphen or anything between ES and 221)

** Cheating
Cheating cases (assignments/codes/exams/project) will be dealt with in accordance with the Institute norms. It is expected that everyone will uphold the honor code.

** Grading
Following will be the weightage of different components of assessment
| Component            | Weightage |
|----------------------+-----------|
| Homework assignments |       20% |
| In-class submissions |       25% |
| Tutorials            |       25% |
| Exams (two)          |  15% each |

** Modes of formal assessment
- Tutorials will involve two types of problems:
	- Set A: to be submitted within the tutorial session and will be graded towards Tutorial weightage
	- Set B: to be practiced outside the tutorial hour and will not be graded
- Assignments will entail analysis/practical problems, reports, etc. and may be individual or group
- Expect one assignment and tutorial per week.
	
** Emphasis on self-learning
It is important to develop the habit of self-learning. A number of reading assignments and self-exercises will be given during the course. These will not be formally graded and it will be expected that students will go through them on a regular basis on their own.
