* Course objectives, syllabus, books, pre-requisites
** Objectives
- To learn matrix stiffness method for analysis of skeletal structures.
- To develop a computer program to perform analysis of skeletal structures based on the direct stiffness method.
- To learn analysis of structural systems with material and/or geometric nonlinearities.
	
** After finishing this course, you will
- understand matrix analysis of structures
- know how to use computer programming to analyze large structural systems
- understand nonlinear analysis of structures

** Syllabus
- Review of basic structural analysis methods: indeterminacy, force, displacement, energy methods of analysis.
- Matrix method of analysis: flexibility method (only introduction) and stiffness method for linear elastic cases (direct formulation).
- Consideration of geometric nonlinearity in direct stiffness method; P-delta effects.
- Incremental plastic analysis, formation of plastic hinges, consideration of material nonlinearity in direct stiffness method (incremental formulation).

** Reference Books
- Intermediate Structural Analysis - C.K. Wang - Tata McGraw Hill.
- Matrix Analysis of Framed Structures - William Weaver Jr. and James M. Gere - CBS Publishers.
- Matrix Structural Analysis - William McGuire, Richard H. Gallagher and Ronald D. Ziemian ([[http://www.mastan2.com/textbook.html][download]]).
- Advanced Analysis and Design of Steel Frames - Guo-Qiang Li and Jin-Jun Li - Wiley.
- Plastic Analysis and Design of Steel Structures - M. Bill Wong - Elsevier.

** Pre-requisites
- Knowledge of basic linear algebra:
  - rank, column space, null space of a matrix,
  - solving system of linear algebraic equations,
  - computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- Knowledge of a programming language:
  - Matlab is a good option. Here is an excellent [[http://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab/matlab_overview.htm][tutorial]].
  - [[http://www.scilab.org/][Scilab]] is a free alternative to Matlab.
  - In case you feel adventurous, you can use C++ as well.

* Course Policies
** Etiquette
- Please be considerate about everyone's time.
- In all emails pertaining to this course, please have "CE607" in the subject line.
	- (note that there is no space or hyphen or anything between CE and 607)

** Cheating
Cheating cases (assignments/quizzes/exams) will be awarded an F grade and will be reported to academic office. It is expected that this will never happen and everyone will uphold the honor code.

** Late submissions
All delays beyond the defined deadlines will attract reduction in marks as per the following curve.
The reduction factor, $R$ will be multiplied to the obtained marks. Mathematically, it is given by: $R = \exp(-D^2)$, where $D$ is the total delay in days (will be counted hourly, i.e. fractional days are possible).

** Grading
Following will be the weightage of different components of assessment
| Component            | Weightage |
|----------------------+-----------|
| Homework assignments |       30% |
| Spot quizzes         |       20% |
| Class participation  |       10% |
| Midsem exam          |       20% |
| Endsem exam          |       20% |

** Modes of formal assessment
- Assignments will involve detailed analysis and design questions.
- Expect one assignment per week.
- Spot quizzes will primarily be objective type, primarily based on concepts and codes. Expect one quiz per week.
- Exam will primarily be subjective type. It may be in-class or take-home.
	
** Emphasis on self-learning
It is important to develop the habit of self-learning. A number of reading assignments and self-exercises will be given during the course. These will not be formally graded and it will be expected that students will go through them on a regular basis on their own.
