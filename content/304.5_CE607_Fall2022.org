* Course objectives, syllabus, books, pre-requisites
** Objective
- To learn matrix stiffness method for analysis of skeletal structures.
- To develop a computer program to perform analysis of skeletal structures based on the direct stiffness method.
- To learn analysis of structural systems with material and/or geometric nonlinearities.
	
** After finishing this course, you will
- understand matrix analysis of structures
- know how to use computer programming to analyze large structural systems
- understand nonlinear analysis of structures

** Syllabus
- Review of basic structural analysis methods: indeterminacy, force, displacement, energy methods of analysis.
- Matrix method of analysis: flexibility method (only introduction) and stiffness method for linear elastic cases (direct formulation).
- Consideration of geometric nonlinearity in direct stiffness method; P-delta effects.
- Incremental plastic analysis, formation of plastic hinges, consideration of material nonlinearity in direct stiffness method (incremental formulation).

** Reference Books
- Intermediate Structural Analysis - C.K. Wang - Tata McGraw Hill.
- Matrix Analysis of Framed Structures - William Weaver Jr. and James M. Gere - CBS Publishers.
- Matrix Structural Analysis - William McGuire, Richard H. Gallagher and Ronald D. Ziemian ([[http://www.mastan2.com/textbook.html][download]]).
- Advanced Analysis and Design of Steel Frames - Guo-Qiang Li and Jin-Jun Li - Wiley.
- Plastic Analysis and Design of Steel Structures - M. Bill Wong - Elsevier.

** Pre-requisites
- Knowledge of basic linear algebra:
  - rank, column space, null space of a matrix,
  - solving system of linear algebraic equations,
  - computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- Knowledge of a programming language:
  - Matlab is a good option. Here is an excellent [[http://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab/matlab_overview.htm][tutorial]].
  - [[http://www.scilab.org/][Scilab]] is a free alternative to Matlab.
  - In case you feel adventurous, you can use C++ as well.

* Course Policies
** Etiquette
- Please be considerate about everyone's time.
- In all emails pertaining to this course, please have "CE607" in the subject line.
	- (note that there is no space or hyphen or anything between CE and 607)

** Cheating
Cheating cases (assignments/quizzes/exams) will be awarded an F grade and will be reported to academic office. It is expected that this will never happen and everyone will uphold the honor code.

** Late submissions
All delays beyond the defined deadlines will attract reduction in marks as per the following curve.
The reduction factor, $R$ will be multiplied to the obtained marks. Mathematically, it is given by: $R = \exp(-D^2)$, where $D$ is the total delay in days (will be counted hourly, i.e. fractional days are possible).

** Grading
Following will be the weightage of different components of assessment
| Component            | Weightage |
|----------------------+-----------|
| Homework assignments |       30% |
| Spot quizzes         |       20% |
| Class participation  |       10% |
| Midsem exam          |       20% |
| Endsem exam          |       20% |

** Modes of formal assessment
- Assignments will involve detailed analysis and design questions.
- Expect one assignment per week.
- Spot quizzes will primarily be objective type, primarily based on concepts and codes. Expect one quiz per week.
- Exam will primarily be subjective type. It may be in-class or take-home.
	
** Emphasis on self-learning
It is important to develop the habit of self-learning. A number of reading assignments and self-exercises will be given during the course. These will not be formally graded and it will be expected that students will go through them on a regular basis on their own.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
* Project
The basic idea of a project is to utilize the knowledge gained from this course to a real-life situation or to better understand certain concepts that remain hidden otherwise. Think of a scenario which was fascinating (perhaps during one of your earlier site visits) and which made you think 'how was this structure designed or analyzed'. Or, when you were designing a structure (say using IS 456:2000) and were wondering why span/d ratio is restricted to a certain number for different cases and how does that relate to the deflection. Or, when you were considering plastic moment capacity of a steel beam, and were wondering how to analyze a structure in the intermediate stage (i.e. past the elastic stage but before it yields completely). Or, when simply considering load combinations from IS 875, you were wondering how much uncertainty can the load factors cater for, and how would a structure behave under uncertainty (if actual values were to be used).

Try to answer some/more such questions during the project. Ideally, you would choose a reasonably complicated looking real-world problem and analyze it using a software (either the one you will develop as part of the course, or SAP, or Mastan2, or any other that you may know of).


** Timeline
Project is to be done in groups of not more than 3. Following timeline must be adhered to for all submissions. (this timeline will be updated during the first week of classes)

*** Guidelines on the final report
This report should be organized as follows:
1) Discussion of the existing design (critical review of existing design).
2) Description of alternative proposal.
3) Detailed analysis and design of alternative proposal.
4) Highlighting improvements of the alternative proposal over existing design.
5) Conclusions.
6) References.
