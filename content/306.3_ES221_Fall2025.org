** Cheating
Cheating cases (assignments/codes/exams/project) will be dealt with in accordance with the Institute norms. It is expected that everyone will uphold the honor code.

** Grading
Following will be the weightage of different components of assessment
| Component            | Weightage |
|----------------------+-----------|
| Homework assignments |       20% |
| In-class submissions |       25% |
| Tutorials            |       25% |
| Exams (two)          |  15% each |

** Modes of formal assessment
- Tutorials will involve two types of problems:
  - Set A: to be submitted within the tutorial session and will be graded towards Tutorial weightage
  - Set B: to be practiced outside the tutorial hour and will not be graded
- Assignments will entail analysis/practical problems, reports, etc. and may be individual or group
- Expect one assignment and tutorial per week.
- All assignments and tutorials can be downloaded from [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11yCs_XVtDW0ATJPo-Vr_x_4C3R2DEiWw?usp=sharing][this google folder]].
	
** Emphasis on self-learning
It is important to develop the habit of self-learning. A number of reading assignments and self-exercises will be given during the course. These will not be formally graded and it will be expected that students will go through them on a regular basis on their own.
