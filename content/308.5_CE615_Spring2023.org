* Course objectives, syllabus, books, pre-requisites
** Objectives
- To understand implications of fire on structural systems
- To understand design of RCC and steel structures under fire
- To understand fire rating and design for fire safety
	
** Syllabus
- Review of performance-based design concepts, LRFD cold design of RCC and steel structures.
- Fire models and scenarios, load calculations.
- Design considerations for individual members (tensile, compressive and flexural) in fire.
- Fire proofing materials, fire safety ratings.
- Behavior of structural systems under fire, preventive/protective mechanisms.
- Exhaustive syllabus is as follows
	- Review of performance-based design concepts, LRFD cold design of RCC and steel structures; codified models for fire, standard and natural fire; material behavior of steel and concrete constituents in fire; estimation of time-temperature curves for structural members in different fire and exposure/ventilation scenarios; design considerations for individual members exposed to fire: structural members in tension, compression, bending; provisions in Eurocodes and IS 456, 800, 1641, 1642 and 1643 to ensure fire safety; fire proofing materials used to enhance fire resistance of structural members; behavior of structural systems under fire; preventive/protective systems for structures.

* Course Policies
** Etiquette
- Please be considerate about everyone's time.
- In all emails pertaining to this course, please have "CE615" in the subject line.
	- (note that there is no space or hyphen or anything between CE and 615)

** Cheating
Cheating cases (assignments/codes/exams/project) will be dealt with in accordance with the Institute norms. It is expected that everyone will uphold the honor code.

** Late submissions
All delays beyond the defined deadlines will attract reduction in marks as per the following curve.
The reduction factor, $R$ will be multiplied to the obtained marks. Mathematically, it is given by: $R = \exp(-D^2)$, where $D$ is the total delay in days (will be counted hourly, i.e. fractional days are possible).

** Grading
Following will be the weightage of different components of assessment
| Component            | Weightage |
|----------------------+-----------|
| Homework assignments |       40% |
| Exams (three)        |  20% each |

** Modes of formal assessment
- Assignments will entail analysis/design problems, practical problems, visit reports, etc.
- Exams will involve take home type analysis/design problems along with viva/presentations.
	
** Emphasis on self-learning
It is important to develop the habit of self-learning. A number of reading assignments and self-exercises will be given during the course. These will not be formally graded and it will be expected that students will go through them on a regular basis on their own.
