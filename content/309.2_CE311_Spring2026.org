*Note*:
1. Tutorial hours will be used for problem-solving, covering theoretical aspects of the laboratory, and hands-on laboratory experiments, as relevant for the topics being covered.
2. The remainder of this website has information pertaining to the theory part of the course.
3. The laboratory part of the course will use a Google Classroom (Code: wg7cn6k). More information is available here ([[https://iitgnacin-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/siva_chopperla_iitgn_ac_in/EXN5nsZQEQxGm6IeGD7rpGwBHYBSjKF5czc9GGqBC9-T4A?e=yZQSkb][link to PDF]]).

# comment
	
** Reference Book
- Limit State Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures - P C Verghese.

** Required codes
- IS 456(2000): Plain and reinforced concrete - Code of Practice
- IS 875-1(1987): Code of practice for design loads (other than earthquake) for buildings and structures [Dead Loads]
- IS 875-2(1987): Code of practice for design loads (other than earthquake) for buildings and structures [Imposed Loads]
- IS 875-3(2015): Code of practice for design loads (other than earthquake) for buildings and structures [Wind Loads]
- SP 16(1980): Design aids for reinforced concrete to IS 456

*Note*:
- Please have a printed copy of the codes available during classes, tutorials and exams.
- During the exams, only printed copies of the codes will be allowed.

** Pre-requisites
- Good background in Mechanics of Solids.
- Good background in Structural Analysis.
- Curiosity to learn the fundamentals behind construction of some of the largest structures like Hoover Dam and Burj Khalifa.

* Course Policies
** Etiquette
- Please be considerate about everyone's time.
- In all emails pertaining to this course, please have "CE311" in the subject line.
	- (note that there is no space or hyphen or anything between CE and 311)

** Cheating
Cheating cases (assignments/codes/exams/project) will be dealt with in accordance with the Institute norms. It is expected that everyone will uphold the honor code.

** Grading
- Theory part comprises of 70% of the overall grading (remaining 30% is for laboratory)
- Following will be the weightage of different components of assessment for the theory part
| Component            | Weightage |
|----------------------+-----------|
| Homework assignments |       25% |
| In-class submissions |       15% |
| Exams (two)          |  15% each |

** Modes of formal assessment
- Assignments will involve two types of problems:
	- Set A: to be submitted for grading
	- Set B: to be practiced and will not be graded (this is treated as tutorial; help will be available from the TAs/instructor for solving, if needed)
- Exams will involve take home type analysis/design problems along with viva/presentations.
- Expect one assignment per week.
	
** Emphasis on self-learning
It is important to develop the habit of self-learning. A number of reading assignments and self-exercises will be given during the course. These will not be formally graded and it will be expected that students will go through them on a regular basis on their own.

* Calendar (tentative)
